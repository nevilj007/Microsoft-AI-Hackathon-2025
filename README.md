# BuildBot: Zero-Cost CI/CD Assistant

BuildBot is a lightweight AI-powered assistant designed to integrate with GitHub Actions. It helps automate build triggering, status monitoring, and log summarization with zero cost, making your CI/CD workflows smarter and faster. 

## Features:
- **Trigger workflows** on GitHub via AI-based commands.
- **Monitor GitHub Actions build status** and receive detailed feedback.
- **Summarize CI/CD logs** using AI to identify errors and suggest actionable fixes.
- **Seamlessly integrate** with your existing GitHub repository and workflows.

## Requirements

### Prerequisites:
- GitHub repository with Actions set up.
- GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with required permissions.
- Python 3.8 or above.
- Required permissions in the workflow for auto dispatch in GitHub:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      tag:
        description: "Docker image tag"
        required: false
        default: "latest"
```

### Packages:
You will need the following Python libraries:

- `httpx`
- `requests`
- `python-dotenv`
- `argparse`

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone this repository to your local machine into your project directory for eg:buildbot :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/buildbot.git](https://github.com/nevilj007/Microsoft-AI-Hackathon-2025.git
```

### 2. Set up a virtual environment

Navigate to the project directory and set up a virtual environment:

```bash
cd buildbot
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

#### On Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set up GitHub API token

Create a `secrets.env` file in the `config/` directory with the following content:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
GITHUB_REPO=your_github_username/repo_name
```

Replace `your_github_personal_access_token` with your GitHub token and `your_github_username/repo_name` with your GitHub repository details.

### 5. Run DeepSeek-Coder Model

Ensure the `deepseek-coder:6.7b-instruct` model from Ollama is running:

```bash
ollama run deepseek-coder:6.7b-instruct
```

The AI will process CI logs and summarize them based on the prompts given.

## Usage

Once everything is set up, you can trigger workflows with the following command:

```bash
python -m cli.minibot --say "Deploy my app"
```

### Optional Parameters:

- If you want to specify the **branch** and **workflow filename** directly, include them inside the quotation marks:

```bash
python -m cli.minibot --say "Deploy my app on main branch with deploy.yml"
```

- If no branch or workflow filename is provided, the AI will prompt you to input the necessary information.

### Workflow Dispatch Permissions Example

In your GitHub workflow YAML file, ensure you have the following snippet to enable manual workflow dispatch:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      tag:
        description: "Docker image tag"
        required: false
        default: "latest"
```

This ensures the workflows can be triggered by external requests, such as the one from the `BuildBot` AI.
